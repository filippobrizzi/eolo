# eolo

##Â Build

### Env
The best way to build eolo is to do it inside the docker container provided in the `docker` folder. You can build the container with `build.sh` and start it using `run.sh`.

### Compilation

Eolo uses CMake to build, the build infrastructure is heavily inspired (see copied) from [grape](https://github.com/cvilas/grape).
